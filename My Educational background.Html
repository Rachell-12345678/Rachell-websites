<h2><mark><u>My kindergarten life</u></mark></h2>
       <h3>I began my educational journey at Nahu Senay Kindergarten when I was three years old.<br>where I attended from KG1 to KG3. I had a wonderful childhood, filled with great experiences alongside my friends and teachers.<br> I celebrated special occasions, including my birthday, and received many gifts from my teachers. Eventually, I graduated and received my diploma from the school.<br>
       After kindergarten,</h3>             <h2><mark><u> My Elementary-preparatory</u></mark></h2> <h3>I started a new chapter at Abba Gebre Michael Catholic School ,From grades 1 to 12.<br> I was a curious and clever student in the lower grades. However, after grade 6, I became a dedicated and serious student.<br> I took the general exam in grade 8 and passed with excellent grades, which allowed me to begin grade 9 with new courses and classes.<br> 
       Subsequently, I spent two years learning English at the A Plus Language Center.<br> Afterward, I took the grade 10 national matriculation exam and achieved great results as well.<br> In grade 11, I focused on a natural science course, which included new subjects along with a technical drawing class, and I worked hard to excel.<br> In grade 12, I returned to the language center where I had studied in grade 10 to complete my education and receive my diploma.<br>
       After that, I took the Grade 12 matriculation exam and was accepted into Meles Campus at Mekelle University.</h3> <br> <h2><mark><u>My university life</u></mark></h2> <h3>Then I Entered to the Campus on November,Unfortunately, after three months, we had to stop classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic.<br> which lasted for nearly eight months. During this challenging time, we also faced a civil war in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, which lasted from November 3, 2020, to November 3, 2022.<br>
       After this difficult period, I returned to the main campus of Mekelle University, known as Arid. <br>I began as a second-semester freshman in the pre-engineering department for nearly three months, during which I made many friends and created special memories.<br> After that, I switched to the software engineering department, which was my desired field, and I became a second-year software student.<br> I attended the first semester of my second year for about two months. During this time, I shared amazing experiences with my friends. <br>
       Following a break, I started learning the second semester of the academic year until June 21, but I had to pause the semester due to the exit exam and the Grade 12 matriculation exam.<br> During the summer, I was active in gymnastics and studied some additional courses, but I had to stop due to the start of my second semester in September.<br> Currently, I am a third-year software engineering student, and my plan is to become a great web developer.</h3></p>
